+   Impact of VLSI technologies on computer architectures and computer performances
+    Performance of memory hierarchies in PC implementations
+    Performance evaluation of interconnection networks for parallel and distributed architectures
+    Computer arithmetic
+    Program optimization for high performance and embedded processors



## RESULTS

+    3 patents
+    11 publications in refereed international journals, including
        IEEE Transactions on Computer (2), IEEE Computer (1), IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits (1), Journal of Parallel and distributed computing (1), TCS (1), Future Generation Computer System (1)
+    7 publications in refereed French journals
        TSI (6), Revue de Physique Appliqu√©e (1)
+    58 publications in refereed International Conferences, including
        International Symposium on Multiple Valued Logic (18), Fault Tolerant Computing Symposium (1), Compcon Spring(1), Compcon Fall (1), ESSIRC (1), Design Automation Conference (1), ICCD(1), IEEE Bipolar Technology and Circuits Meeting (2), Euromicro (5), International Conference on Parallel Processing (1), International Parallel Computing Technologies Conference (3), Computer Arithmetic Conference (1), HPCA (1), SC (1), PACT (1) etc.
